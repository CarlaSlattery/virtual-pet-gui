# Virtual Pet

## Description

This was my first project to help me learn about classes and prototypes using Javascript and using Jest for testing. My initial assignmnet was to get the
project working inside of a Node.js environment but as an extra challenge I wanted to develop a GUI for the project for my portfolio and to allow me to 
apply my learning about DOM manipulation. Finally, to give it some additional interactivity I combined the GUI with the code of an earlier project of mine 
which happened to be a fun 'dog-picker' web application linked to an external API - [dog.ceo](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

The result is a simple but fun Tamogochi style web app!üòÅ

### How to Play

Once you've adopted your chosen dog, you must select how to care for it based on it's vital statistics panel. To progress you select for your dog to 'Grow Up'
which will age them for one year - pay attention to how this affects their vital statistics though! If their hunger gets too high or their fitness or happiness
get's too low, your dog will pass away and you'll have to choose another. The good news is that these dogs can live longer than average - up to 30years, if
you can give them your TLC.
